Hello. This is Kristin and this is Joe ... we wanted to take a moment to welcome you to the Learn RealEnglish Family and to tell you a little about the lessons.
Now these lessons are based on real, authentic English conversations that Joe and I have had with eachother and our friends...and also with my mom. These are actual conversations that we have had so you will
become familiar, more familiar, with real spoken English.So you'll hear Kristin and I in the conversations and also doing the lessons. You will also hear our friend AJ
Hoge from Effortless English. He's done some of the lessons as well.Okay, so now a little bit about the lessons . . . Each lesson set has a conversation, a vocabulary lesson and a
mini - story lesson for you to listen to.And we have also included the text for each of these, in case you want to
read along as you listen. The key to Learn Real English is deep learning.The best way to use these lessons is to listen to one lesson
set at a time.You should spend at least one week on each lesson set.Now remember… one lesson set has a conversation, a vocabulary lesson and a mini - story lesson in it.So listen to the lesson set every day for at
least one week before moving on to the next set.Even if the lesson set is easy, you should still continue forone week. And if after a week the lesson set is difficult, continue listening until you have a basic
understanding.Also, you want to be sure that you do the lesson sets in order because the ones at the end
are more difficult.We've included a welcome guide that has more instructions. So please read it before you start listening to
the lessons. And if you have any questions or comments about the lessons you can go to our discussion board.It is at www.EffortlessEnglishForums.com.
Okay, so now you’re ready to start. Thanks for joining the Learn Real English family.And good luck with the lessons.But most importantly, make sure you have fun.Bye.
